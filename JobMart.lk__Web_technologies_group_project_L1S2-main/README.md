The JobMart.lk is a commercial web application that provides the opportunities to post their available vaconcies in an organization and,
also to find available vaconcies, who interested to find a new job for their own qualifications. 

The web application is able to dealing with a database to store and retrieve all the data that are needed.

It provides the facilities to create an own account with sign up for an organization. Then they are able to post their available vaconcies with required qualifications and alsp to get a list of all vaconcies they posted.

Individual users have two options to search for a job even without sign up such as entering their own qualifications or using a single key word. 

We created a demo video to show how it works with our local database.

Finaly we want to say, the project is in the very basic level and there are lot of bugs and inefficiencies to fix. 
we are looking to work with the project further to pullup it to the real world commercial level.  

Thank you!
